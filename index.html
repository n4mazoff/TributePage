                        <p><b>Christopher George Latore Wallace</b> (May 21, 1972 - March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names the Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or simply Biggie, was an American rapper and songwriter. Rooted in the New York rap scene and gangsta rap traditions, he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive laid-back lyrical delivery, offsetting the lyrics' often grim content. His music was often semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality, but also of debauchery and celebration.</p>

                            speculations of involvement in Shakur's murder 
                            by criminal elements orbiting the Bad Boy circle circulated as a result of Wallace's public feud with Shakur.</p>
